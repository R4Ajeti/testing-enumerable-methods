## Project 1: ([Testing-Enumerate-Methods]).

This is a microverse project. Click to know more about Microverse. You learned about the Enumerable module that gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides you with lots of handy iterator methods. To prove that there’s no magic to it, you’re going to rebuild those methods. You can test that by using terminal. Just type rspec and you will see test case from rspec
